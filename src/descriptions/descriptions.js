A fixed mindset is the belief that intelligence, talents, and abilities are inherent and unchangeable. People with this mindset may avoid challenges, fearing they are not smart or talented enough to succeed. They often limit themselves to activities within their comfort zone to avoid failure.",

This mindset views feedback and mistakes as opportunities for improvement and values the process of learning and becoming more productive, a concept Dweck refers to as "purposeful engagement." Individuals with a growth mindset see obstacles as challenges to overcome, learning from experiences and persisting until they achieve their goals.',
