                        Following the approval of a refund request, you will
                        receive a reimbursement equivalent to the entire course
                        fee, excluding any processing charges associated with
                        the Stripe payment processor. The precise amount of
                        these fees is contingent upon the selected payment
                        method and whether currency conversion to USD was
                        necessary at the time of payment.
